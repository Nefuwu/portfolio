      'A research-focused task during OJT to evaluate optimal methods for implementing Paddle payment event notifications in our backend.',
    reason:
      'To ensure reliable, timely, and redundant delivery of subscription event updates such as purchases, cancellations, and renewals.',
    process:
      'Analyzed Paddle Webhook documentation, tested simulated requests with local endpoints, and proposed a hybrid integration model combining real-time Webhook event triggers for critical subscription changes with periodic API polling for reconciling event logs and missed notifications. This ensures data consistency and covers Webhook delivery failures.',
    challenges:
      'Managing secure Webhook authentication, handling edge cases in event order, and designing a reliable fallback for missed Webhook calls through API log queries.',
    lessons:
      'Learned the limitations of Webhook-only systems in production, how to architect hybrid event-handling workflows, and how to balance real-time triggers with periodic consistency checks for payment-driven backend systems.',
    content:
      "This OJT research task involved evaluating Paddle's Webhook system for subscription event notifications. After testing Webhook payloads with local endpoints, I identified delivery reliability concerns in case of endpoint failures. To address this, I proposed a hybrid solution: using Webhooks for immediate event triggers like purchases or cancellations, while periodically querying Paddle's API event logs to detect any missed or delayed events, ensuring robust and consistent subscription status updates in our backend database.",
